# ECE 228: Statistical Machine learning for physical applications
Machine Learning For Physical Applications

HW1: Weather Prediction using Random Forests. Explored performance improvements through implementation of traditional linear time series analysis - Signal decomposition into trend, seasonality, and noise.

HW2: Neural Net Backpropagation from scratch in Matlab

Group Project: [2D Steady State Fluid Simulations with CNN's](https://github.com/sguerin13/CNN_2D_CFD_ECE_228)
